My name is Corné, and I work as a freelance [fullstack software developer](https://github.com/cornedriesprong/). I have a lot of experience in mobile (iOS) development and front-end web development (React). I'm particularly interested in music technology, and have developed two iOS/iPadOS music apps: [cykle](https://cp3.io/cykle) and [polybeat](https://cp3.io/polybeat).

In my free time I like to [make music](https://soundcloud.com/sleeprites).
